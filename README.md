# Quantum-Injury-Project

## Description
In this project, quantum computing is used to assess injury risk and return-to-play readiness for collegiate athletes. Athlete features such as age, height, weight, training intensity, workload, and recovery patterns are encoded into quantum states, and a quantum circuit with entanglement and measurement generates an ACL Risk Score that reflects the probability of injury.

This project also incorporates the often-overlooked psychological component of recovery, recognizing that mental readiness is just as critical as physical recovery when determining safe return-to-play timelines. By including validated scales such as I-PRRS (which measures an athleteâ€™s perceived confidence in their recovery) and TSK-11 (which evaluates fear of movement or re-injury), the model expands beyond purely physiological metrics to capture the full spectrum of readiness. The integration of physical and psychological indicators allows the system to classify athletes into Ready to Return, Needs More Time, or Not Ready, creating a more inclusive quantum-based assessment that reflects real-world recovery challenges.
